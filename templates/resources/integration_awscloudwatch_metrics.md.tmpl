## IAM Credentials and Security Implications

It is recommended you create credentials especially for use with this resource which have extremely limited access. A good example is shown in the snippet above, where the `aws_iam_user` resource only has permissions to put metric data into the given AWS CloudWatch namespace.

While is it possible to use the `eventstorecloud_integration` resource with a sink property of `awsCloudWatchMetrics`, it is recommended to use the `eventstorecloud_integration_awscloudwatch_metrics` resource instead as the IAM credentials get marked as sensitive to Terraform and will not be shown when running steps such as `terraform plan`. 

Even then, the IAM credentials given to this resource will be stored in the Terraform raw state as plain-text. More information on sensitive data in Terraform state can be read [here](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).
