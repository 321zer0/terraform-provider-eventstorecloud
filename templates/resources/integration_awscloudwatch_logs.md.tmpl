## IAM Credentials and Security Implications

It is recommended you create credentials especially for use with this resource which have extremely limited access. A good example is shown in the snippet above, where the `aws_iam_user` resource only has permissions to describe log groups in the calling account, and can create and write streams exclusively in the log group which is also created as part of the snippet.

While is it possible to use the `eventstorecloud_integration` resource with a sink property of `awsCloudWatchLogs`, it is recommended to use the `eventstorecloud_integration_awscloudwatch_logs` resource instead as the IAM credentials get marked as sensitive to Terraform and will not be shown when running steps such as `terraform plan`. 

Even then, the IAM credentials given to this resource will be stored in the Terraform raw state as plain-text. More information on sensitive data in Terraform state can be read [here](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).
