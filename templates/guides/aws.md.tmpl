# Event Store Cloud in AWS

The sample project creates the following resources in Event Store Cloud:
- Project
- Network
- Network peering
- Managed EventStoreDB using single F1 node with 16GB disk

From the AWS side, you still need to accept the peering request and configure the route as described in the [documentation](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/provision/aws/#network-peering).
